[*SparkFun MicroMod Main Board - Single (DEV-18575)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18575)

The MicroMod Main Board is a specialized carrier board that allows you to interface a MicroMod Processor Board with a single MicroMod Function Board. With the M.2 MicroMod connector, connecting your Processor and Function Boards is a breeze. Simply match up the key on your board's beveled edge connector to the key on the M.2 connector and secure the boards with screws.

The Single Main Board includes one USB-C connector for power and programming the Processor Board. Two buttons for reset and boot are also populated on the board. Also included on the board is a 2A resettable fuse and 3.3V/1A voltage regulator. We've even added a convenient jumper for advanced users looking to bypass the fuse and another to measure the current consumption for low power testing. For those that need to go remote with their application, the board includes a 2-pin JST connector and a single cell LiPo MCP73831 charge IC (set to a rate of 500mA). Three status LEDs are available for power and charging. There is a microSD card socket so you can also plug in a microSD card for data logging. Finally, two Qwiic connectors are populated on the board to easily add Qwiic enabled I<sup>2</sup>C devices to your projects!
