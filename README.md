The MicroMod Main Board - Single is a specialized carrier board that allows you to interface a MicroMod Processor Board with a single MicroMod Function Board. With the M.2 MicroMod connector, connecting your Processor and Function Boards is a breeze. Simply match up the key on your board's beveled edge connector to the key on the M.2 connector and secure the boards with screws.

The Single Main Board includes one USB-C connector for power and programming the Processor Board. A jumper is available on the back of the board to isolate the USB C's shield pin. Two buttons for reset and boot are also populated on the board. Processor Board pins are also broken out as 2x5 SWD pins. Also, included on the board is a 2A resettable fuse and 3.3V/1A voltage regulator. A second 3.3V/500mA voltage regulator is included on the board to power your Qwiic-enabled devices. We've even added convenient PTH jumpers for advanced users looking to bypass the fuse and measure the current consumption on the 5V and 3.3V lines for low-power testing. For those that need to go remote with their application, the board includes a 2-pin JST connector and a single-cell LiPo MCP73831 charge IC (set to a charge rate of 500mA).

Four status LEDs are available for power and charging. These can also be disabled through jumpers. There is a microSD card socket so you can also plug in a microSD card for data logging. The microSD socket can be disabled through the I/O pins. Finally, two Qwiic connectors are populated on the board with built-in pull-up resistors to easily add Qwiic-enabled I<sup>2</sup>C devices to your projects!
